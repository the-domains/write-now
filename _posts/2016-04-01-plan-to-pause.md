# Plan to pause

When you're about to tackle an ambitious writing project, plan to pause.

Regardless of the scale of the project you're working on or the deadline that lays ahead, you cannot do your background reading, interviews and writing back-to-back. Your brain likes to have a rest between innings to spend time mulling new information.

The trick to producing top quality writing in this situation is to make a schedule, allowing sufficient mulling time between each task.

## Step One

Outline what you propose to do in a tool like [Trello][0]. Make brief file notes with key contacts and requirements. Add any reference material like website links or documents. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/94528f65-90af-4746-9952-ebb611a108ad.png)

## Step Two

Give yourself plenty of time to read far and wide, absorbing as much information as you can. This research phase may also involve conducting interviews and gathering together your file notes.

## Step Three

Write notes. [Organise your information into chunks][1], then put them into a logical order. 

Don't feel any pressure to spin any of this information into coherent sentences at this point. You're just getting your information ready.

## Step Four

Now start writing the main body of your information. Be mindful to avoid creating an opening statement that summarises what you're doing, unless you've got it clearly in mind already. It's best to focus on the bigger picture and start transforming your notes into paragraphs, one sentence at a time.

## Step Five

Take a break from writing and strike a conversation with someone about what you're doing. You'll be surprised how well you can translate what you've learnt into an interesting story. If your work is confidential in nature, just phrase it in a general way.

## Step Six

Read over what you've written and start crafting the opening sentence or statement. 

Once this is done, check your grammar, weed out dead phrases, inject it with meaningful phrases, and keep refining until you're satisfied your piece can proceed to the next stage, whether it be a sub-edit process conducted by someone else, or straight to publishing.
