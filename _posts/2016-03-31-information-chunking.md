# Information chunking 

If there's one skill that I've always been able to fall back on in life, it's writing. It's a learned skill, taught to me not by my many years of schooling, but my father.

The single lesson I carry with me to this day is information chunking. Not the nicest of phrases, but it's evocative and memorable. 

Sure at school we all learnt to have an introduction, middle and ending. This is a solid structure, but it doesn't help me capture the ideas floating around in my mind and weave together the beginnings of a well-written piece. Information chunking, on the other hand, helps me get organised so that the writing will flow.

Essentially you take all the information you have gathered to write, and chunk the key themes together. At this stage there's no need to write beautifully crafted sentences, but if inspiration strikes while you're going through this process, jot those magically crafted words down. 

Once you've redrafted your research, thoughts, file notes and ideas into this coherent structure, move the chunks into order - making the topics flow from one key idea to the next.
